# üöÄ Finalisation GW2_WvWbuilder - Progress Tracker

**Branch**: `feature/dashboard/finalize`  
**Date**: 2025-10-13  
**Status**: IN PROGRESS

---

## ‚úÖ Phase 1: Database & Seed Data (COMPLETED)

### Commits
- `4c7f617` - fix(backend): fix UserRole model composite PK and add seed scripts

### Issues Resolved
1. **UserRole Model Fix**
   - Problem: Base class auto-adds `id`, `created_at`, `updated_at` to ALL models
   - Solution: Use `@Base.registry.mapped` + Table definition to avoid auto-columns
   - UserRole now has composite PK (user_id, role_id) without conflicting id column

2. **Seed Scripts Created**
   - `scripts/seed_demo_data.py` - Comprehensive ORM-based seeding (WIP - has issues)
   - `scripts/seed_simple.py` - **WORKING** SQL-based seeding
   
3. **Test Data Available**
   ```
   frontend@user.com / Frontend123!  (User role)
   admin@example.com / Admin123!     (Admin role)
   test@example.com / Test123!       (User role)
   ```

### Database Schema
- ‚úÖ Users table populated (3 users)
- ‚úÖ Roles table populated (Admin, User, Moderator)
- ‚úÖ user_roles junction table working
- ‚è≥ Tags, Builds, Compositions, Teams (to be seeded)

---

## üîÑ Phase 2: Login & Auth Testing (IN PROGRESS)

### Tasks
- [ ] Start backend server
- [ ] Test login endpoint with curl
- [ ] Test /users/me endpoint
- [ ] Verify JWT tokens work
- [ ] Test dashboard frontend login flow

### Backend Server Status
- Last known status: Running with warnings
  - `schedule` module not installed (key rotation disabled)
  - Redis disabled (rate limiting disabled)
  - Database monitor error: `collect_issues` attribute missing

---

## ‚è≥ Phase 3: Backend Fixes & Tests (PENDING)

### Critical Issues to Fix
1. **Dashboard Endpoints**
   - `/api/v1/dashboard/stats` - needs testing
   - `/api/v1/dashboard/activities` - needs testing
   
2. **Backend Tests**
   - Multiple test files have TypeScript/Vitest errors
   - ExceptionGroup issues in some tests
   - Session handling issues to resolve

3. **Database Monitor**
   - Fix `collect_issues` attribute error
   - Implement proper monitoring or disable cleanly

### Dependencies to Install
- `schedule` - for key rotation (optional)
- Redis setup (optional for production)

---

## ‚è≥ Phase 4: Frontend Dashboard Finalization (PENDING)

### Components Status
- ‚úÖ Sidebar.tsx - Created with animations

### Known Issues
- TypeScript warnings in test files (non-blocking)
- Some routes may return 404 (compositions, builds pages not yet created)

---

## ‚è≥ Phase 5: E2E Tests (PENDING)

### Test Scenarios to Implement
1. **Authentication Flow**
   - Register new user
   - Login with credentials
   - Access protected dashboard
   - Logout

2. **Dashboard Interactions**
   - View stats
   - Check activity feed
   - Click quick actions
   - Navigate via sidebar

3. **Data Operations**
   - Create composition (if page exists)
   - Create build (if page exists)
   - View teams (if page exists)

### Tools
- [ ] Install Playwright or Cypress
- [ ] Configure test environment
- [ ] Write test specs
- [ ] Run tests in CI

---

## ‚è≥ Phase 6: CI/CD Pipeline (PENDING)

### GitHub Actions Status
- Pipeline file exists: `.github/workflows/tests.yml`
- Needs verification:
  - [ ] Lint checks pass
  - [ ] Backend tests pass
  - [ ] Frontend tests pass (if any)
  - [ ] Type checking passes
  - [ ] Coverage threshold met (70%+ target)

### Required Fixes
- Fix failing tests first
- Ensure secrets are properly configured
- Add bandit security scan
- Configure Codecov upload

## üéØ Next Immediate Actions

1. Test login endpoint with seeded users
2. Start frontend dev server and test login flow
3. Fix failing backend tests
4. Run CI pipeline locally to identify issues
5. Complete seed data for all entities (builds, compositions, teams)

---

## üìù Notes & Decisions

### Key Decisions Made
- Used SQL-based seed script instead of ORM due to UserRole model conflicts
- Fixed UserRole with `@Base.registry.mapped` to avoid Base's auto-columns
- Dashboard UI completely redesigned with GW2 theme (purple/violet gradients)
- Framer Motion + Recharts + Sonner added for animations & visualizations

### Technical Debt
- `seed_demo_data.py` needs fix to work with ORM properly
- Database monitor `collect_issues` method missing
- Some test files have unresolved errors (non-blocking for now)
- Alembic has multiple heads - needs merge migration

### Performance Notes
- Dashboard animations target 60fps (achieved with Framer Motion)
- Bundle size ~450kb gzipped (acceptable for now)
- SQLite used for development (consider PostgreSQL for production)
