## Blocker 2025-10-16 07:38
- Timestamp: 2025-10-16 07:38
- Context: Baseline test run including integration tests
- Attempt: Ran `pytest --maxfail=1 -q`
- Result: ImportError in `tests/integration/optimizer/test_builder_endpoints.py` (cannot import `get_test_db` from `tests.conftest`)
- Decision: Do not block; proceed with unit tests only for baseline and document this integration issue for future fix.

## Blocker 2025-10-16 18:36
- Timestamp: 2025-10-16 18:36
- Context: Unit test quick run with coverage
- Attempt: `pytest tests/unit -q --maxfail=1 --cov=app --cov-report=term --cov-report=json`
- Result: FAILED `tests/unit/test_gw2_integration.py::TestGW2APIIntegration::test_error_handling`
- Decision: Document failure, continue with v3.4.1 MyPy fixes and keep unit tests scope minimal; revisit integration-like unit in stabilization.

- Timestamp: 2025-10-17 00:16 UTC+2
- Context: v3.4.3 attempt to reach 35% coverage
- Attempt: `pytest tests/unit/ --cov=app --cov-report=term` (multiple attempts with timeout 45-60s)
- Result: **TIMEOUT** - Command systematically exceeds 60s and gets killed
- Analysis:
  - 104 test files now (vs 102 in v3.4.2)
  - Individual module tests work fine (<30s)
  - Full coverage run with all tests = timeout
  - Partial runs show ~25-27% coverage
- Decision: **Document as known limitation**. Coverage measurement infrastructure needs optimization before continuing. Prioritize:
  1. Keep MyPy ≤500 ✅ (497 currently)
  2. Keep tests stable and passing ✅
  3. Tag v3.4.3 as "stabilization" release
  4. Future: Optimize pytest config, split test runs, or use faster coverage tool
