### ❌ Failed Jobs (2/17)

- ❌ **Deploy to Staging**: FAIL (No staging server configured)
- ❌ **Deploy to Production**: FAIL (No production server configured)

## ⚠️ Known Issues (Non-Critical)

### Deployment Jobs

**Issue**: Deploy to Staging/Production fail  
**Impact**: LOW - Expected behavior  
**Reason**: No actual deployment infrastructure configured  
**Resolution**: These jobs are gated to `workflow_dispatch` and marked `continue-on-error: true`

### MyPy Warnings

**Issue**: 251 type checking warnings  
**Impact**: LOW - Informational only  
**Reason**: Complex Pydantic models and dynamic types  
**Plan**: Address incrementally in future releases
